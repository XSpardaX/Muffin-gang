 # Muffin Man: The Grand Muffin Heist

You play as **the Muffin Man**, a determined (and slightly unhinged) pastry detective trying to solve the biggest crime in bakery history: **someone stole the Grand Muffin**.

## Premise

- **Setting**: A slightly noir, slightly silly city where baked goods are serious business.
- **Goal**: Interrogate three gang members to figure out **which one stole the Grand Muffin**.
- **Twist**: Each character has their own alibi, personality, and tells. Some will lie, some will omit, some will accidentally give themselves away.

## Core Gameplay (Planned)

- **Interrogations**: 
  - Talk to each of the three gang members.
  - Choose from different dialogue options to press them, comfort them, or catch them off guard.
  - Collect clues, contradictions, and keywords from their responses.
- **Evidence Board**:
  - Track what each suspect claims and what you’ve discovered.
  - Mark contradictions or suspicious patterns.
- **Final Accusation**:
  - After gathering enough information, choose who you think actually stole the Grand Muffin.
  - The game reacts based on your reasoning and the clues you’ve uncovered.

## Characters (Initial Concepts)

- **Gang Member 1**: The smooth talker who never gives a straight answer.
- **Gang Member 2**: Nervous and jumpy, maybe guilty… or just scared.
- **Gang Member 3**: Overly confident, acts insulted you even suspect them.

## Project Structure (Planned)

For now, this repository only contains this `README.md`. Planned structure:

- `src/` – Game logic, dialogue system, interrogation flow.
- `assets/` – Art, sound, and UI assets.
- `docs/` – Design notes, narrative outlines, and additional documentation.

## Getting Started (Once Git Is Installed)

1. **Initialize git** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: setup Muffin Man game repo"
   ```
2. As we build out the game, we’ll add instructions here for running and developing it.

## Vision

The goal is to create a short, replayable interrogation game where:

- Each playthrough can reveal new dialogue or hidden details.
- Players feel clever when they spot contradictions.
- The tone balances **humor**, **mystery**, and **pastry-themed drama**.

More details, mechanics, and technical choices will be added as the project evolves.
